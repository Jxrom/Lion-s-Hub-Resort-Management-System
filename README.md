# Lion's Hub Resort Management-System (CRUD Application)

## Description

Hello! Welcome to my personal project! The motivation of this desktop application is to challenge my skills when it comes to programming in general, specifically targeting the concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, Procedural Programming, Database Management and Software Designing. Basically, this is same as my first project "COVID-19 Management System (CRUD Applicaiton)" but with a more focus on software design and its functionality such as the PDF Export.
