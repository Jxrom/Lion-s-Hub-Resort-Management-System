# Lion's Hub Resort Management-System (CRUD Application)

## Description

Hello! Welcome to my personal project! The motivation of this desktop application is to challenge my skills when it comes to programming in general, specifically targeting concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, Procedural Programming, Database management, and Software design. Basically, this is the same as my first project, "COVID-19 Management System (CRUD Application)," but with a greater focus on software design and its functionality, such as the PDF Export.
